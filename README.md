### 100 Days of Python

This is documenting my 100 days of immersion to Python. It is to solidify my Python knowledge before taking any programming/heavy programming courses at Georgia Tech.

Following the roadmap of [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/100-days-of-code-a-complete-guide-for-beginners-and-experienced/)

[Day One](https://github.com/ivymorenomt/100daysofPython/blob/master/dayone.py): Beginner's Python

Overall functionality of the code is to read text from a file and converting it to a list
I have also created the following functions:
* Reading from files.
* Reading input from the console.
* Split strings

Day Two should be able to parse on CSV files, and write to a file
