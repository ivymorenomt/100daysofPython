### 100 Days of Python

This is documenting my 100 days of immersion to Python. It is to solidify my Python knowledge before taking any programming/heavy programming courses this coming Summer/Fall 2021.

Following the roadmap of [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/100-days-of-code-a-complete-guide-for-beginners-and-experienced/)
