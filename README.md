### 100 Days of Python

This is documenting my 100 days of immersion to Python. It is to solidify my Python knowledge before taking any programming/heavy programming courses at Georgia Tech.

[Day One](https://github.com/ivymorenomt/100daysofPython/blob/master/dayone.py): 

Read text from a file and converting it to a list

I have also created the following functions:
* Reading from files.
* Reading input from the console.
* Split strings
