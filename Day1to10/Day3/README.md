## [Day 3](https://github.com/ivymorenomt/100daysofPython/blob/master/Day1to10/daythree.py):

List - it is a collection or grouping of items; also known as Array
Methods:
* Append
* Insert
* Extend
* Reversed() or use slicing which is [::-1] where negative one is the last index
* Sorted

to access items, use array[indexnumber]
to check values in the list, use 'string' in array statement

Dictionary = it has key,value pairs

#### Understanding Data Structures
When to use a list/dictionary?

A list has order(which has index), a dictionary has no order.
A user may have details so use dictionary
List only has single value. It is only an index and some sort of value
Dictionary has a key and a value.
