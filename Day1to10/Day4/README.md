## [Day 4](https://github.com/ivymorenomt/100daysofPython/blob/master/Day1to10/dayfour.py):

#### Add Elements:
* Append - you could only add one element, at the end of the list
* Extend - you could add more items in a list
* Insert - you can insert the item at a given position (index, value)

#### Remove / Clear Elements
* Clear - will remove all items from the list
* Pop - remove the item at the given position in the list and return it; if no index is specified removes and returns last item in teh list
* Remove - removes the first item from the list whose value is x; it throws a valueerror if the item is not found

#### Index, Count, Sort, Reverse and Join
* Index - returns the index of the specified item in the list or start and end
* count - it outputs the number of times x appears in the list
* Reverse - reverse the elements; it does not create a new list but updates this list
* Sort - sorts the elements in place
* Join - convert the two strings and joins them
